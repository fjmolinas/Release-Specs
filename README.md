RIOT Release Specs
==================

This repository contains specifications and corresponding tests that have to be
fulfilled before a new RIOT release can be tagged.


Procedures
----------

Each RIOT release is accompanied by a set of release specifications, that have
to be passed before each RIOT release. The current master of this repository
contains the specs, that are applicable for the next release. So if we are in
feature freeze before a release, the release can only be tagged once all specs
that are in master of this repo are passed.

For traceability of past releases, a branch and a tag with the RIOT release name
is created on the day of the RIOT release. This way it is always clear, which
set of specs has been passed for specific release.


Specifications
--------------

### Structure

Each specification resides in it's own folder. Inside the folder you can find
a markdown file, that describes the specification and it's tasks in detail.
Optionally there are can be a number of test scripts and test applications for
each task.

A specification folder might look like the following:
```
/04-short-description
  | - spec-04.md
  | - test-04.01.py     -> test script for spec 04, task 01
  | - test-04.02.py
  | - test-04.03/       -> folder containing a specific RIOT test application
  |     | - main.c
  |     | - Makefile
  | - test-04.03.sh     -> some script making use of the test-04.03 application
  | - ....
/05-some-other-spec
  | - spec-05.md
  ...
/README.md
```

### Specs document

The release specifications are descriptions of test-cases and certain other
criteria that have to be tested/applied before each RIOT release. Each
specification contains a description of it's goal as well as a number of tasks
that have to be carried out (as much automated as possible).

Each tasks is to be written in the style of a test-case. This means, that the
following information must be given for each task:
- pre-requisites (e.g. RIOT application used, hardware used, network topology, )
- descriptions of how to exactly carry out the task (step-by-step if possible)
- a precise list of passing/failing criteria, so that there is no doubt if a
  task was successful or not

### Test scripts and applications

Each release specification should be accompanied by supporting scripts (and RIOT
applications if needed), that enable to execute it's tasks to the highest degree
of automation possible. The long-term goal is the complete automated execution
of all tasks, though there might be some cases where this is not achievable...

Tracking
--------

**TODO: verify if feasible of find other means to track the state**

The release spec repository also contains a tracking document (`results.md`),
which contains for each release candidate a full list of tasks that have to be
run, including the results, the exact RIOT commit the task was run with and the
date when  this was done.

This document serves (i) as a tracking document during the feature freeze phase
of a new release and (ii) as a back-reference, so we can trace which tasks have
been run for old releases.

The document `results.md` should have the following format:
```

Pytest runner
-------------

To use pytest to run the test install the local pkg `pip install .`, `riotnode`
package will also need to be installed.

By default experiments will be launched on iot-lab saclay site since it has most
of the boards used in the release-specs.

```
usage: pytest [--boards] [--local] [--riotbase RIOTBASE]

optional arguments:
  --riotbase            RIOT directory to test, default uses environment
                        variable RIOTBASE.
  --boards              String list of boards to use for the test, can be
                        IOTLAB_NODE or RIOT BOARDs.
  --local               Use local boards, default=False (will use iotlab)
```
