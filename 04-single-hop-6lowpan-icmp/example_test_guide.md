_The following is a possible way to run the tests, this is just an example_
## Goal: Check single hop 6lowpan icmp

### Pre-setup Steps
_One can use IoT-LAB for everything but the remote-revb boards_
1. Get 2 of the following boards: `samr21-xpro`, `iotlab-m3`
2. Get the following boards:`remote-revb`, `arduino-zero` with `xbee` module
3. `cd ${RIOTBASE}/tests/gnrc_udp`
4. Setup a terminal for each board _(tmux is your friend)_
5. Find the serial numbers and ports with `ls /dev/serial/by-id/` or with
`make -C tests/gnrc_udp list-ttys`
6. For the samr21 terminals use the following to setup the env
_eg_ `export BOARD=samr21-xpro && export SERIAL=<SAMR_SERIAL> && export PORT=<SAMR_PORT>`

`export BOARD=samr21-xpro && export SERIAL=ATML2127031800008334 && export PORT=/dev/ttyACM0`

`export BOARD=samr21-xpro && export PORT_=ATML2127031800002161 && export PORT=/dev/ttyACM1`
7. For the remote-revb:
_eg_ `export BOARD=remote-revb && export PORT=<REMOTE_PORT> && export PORT_LINUX=${PORT}`

`export BOARD=remote-revb && export PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 && export PORT_LINUX=${PORT}`

`export BOARD=remote-revb && export PORT=/dev/ttyUSB1 && export PORT_LINUX=${PORT}`
8. For the iotlab-m3 the flashing must be done when the other is unplugged or
turned off as there is no way to distinguish between nodes:
_eg_ `export BOARD=iotlab-m3 && export PORT=<M3_PORT>`

`export BOARD=iotlab-m3 && export PORT=/dev/ttyUSB3`

`export BOARD=iotlab-m3 && export PORT=/dev/ttyUSB5`
9. Use `make flash term` to access the nodes (or just `make term` if the
firmware is already flashed)

_note: Boards types can be changed to help vary the test coverage_

Task #01 - ICMPv6 link-local echo with iotlab-m3
================================================
### Description

ICMPv6 echo request/reply exchange between two iotlab-m3 nodes
1. On the dest node use `ifconfig`
2. Copy the link local address `inet6 addr: fe80::... scope: local VAL`, it
should look like `fe80::1711:6b10:65f8:b43a`
3. Ping from the src to the dest `ping6 -c 1000 -i 20 -s 0 <ll_addr>`
4. Record the packet loss, it should be less then 10%
_(if packet loss is high try to increase the -i value as it may be a property of
the async ping6 call)_
5. check the packet buffer with `pktbuf` once everything is complete
_(as long as there is no hex dump it should be fine)_

### Result

<10% packets lost on the pinging node.
